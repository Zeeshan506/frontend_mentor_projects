This is my solution to the [Huddle landing page with single introductory section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-a-single-introductory-section-B_2Wvxgi0). This challenge helped me refresh my frontend skills, especially with modern CSS and Tailwind.
